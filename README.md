This project implements tumor detection using the YOLO v11 model for image segmentation.
The dataset was labeled manually, but you can use publicly available datasets from Kaggle or Roboflow.
The project includes image preprocessing techniques, segmentation visualization, and model training. 

Libraries needed
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
PyTorch
Ultralytics YOLO
Numpy
Matplotlib
Roboflow SDK

Acknowledgments
YOLO v11 by Ultralytics
Roboflow for dataset management
OpenCV for image processing
Matplotlib & NumPy for visualization and numerical operations

Disclaimer
This project is for research and educational purposes. The dataset was labeled manually, which may introduce errors. 
Please verify and improve the dataset as needed for better accuracy.
This project is not mean to be used in a real medical enviroment. To do so, it'll requiere a deeper and better trainning.
